My own web portfolio.

Hey there, I'm Veronika! Originally knee-deep in science, molecular genetics, and Ph.D. studies, I've taken a turn toward the IT world. Now, I'm on a path to becoming a frontend developer and UX designer. My journey started with Czechitas, where I learned to code and I just found myself. I have been learning ever since â€” taking various courses on Udemy, improving my coding skills, creating wireframes, UI and prototypes in Figma, and delving into JavaScript programming.
